# üé¨ Emotion-Based Movie Recommender

> **‚ú® This project explores the trade-off between optimizing for accuracy (past behavior) and enabling human discovery (future growth).**
> 
> - Optimizing for clicks and past behavior can limit discovery  
> - Recommenders risk becoming echo chambers of taste  
> - We shift from predicting behavior to supporting emotional growth  
> - This tool helps people **name and explore** feelings ‚Äî not just repeat them  
> 
> üí° *Can we build a system that helps people say:*  
> ‚Äú**That‚Äôs exactly how I needed to feel ‚Äî and I didn‚Äôt even know it.**‚Äù

## üöÄ Try the App

üîó [Launch the Emotion-Based Recommender App](https://emotion-movie-recommender-gnfazrztxfmeyghyf444xo.streamlit.app/)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The app requires an OpenAI API key to function.  
> Add your API key as a secret in Streamlit:  
> Go to `Settings > Secrets` and add:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_key_here"
```

## üñºÔ∏è Example Output

Here's an example of a user searching for:  
`Self-destructive dramedy, esp. about egotistic writers`

## üîç Problem

Traditional recommender systems often suggest movies by:
- Genre (e.g. "comedy", "thriller")
- User behavior (e.g. watch history, ratings)

But:
- **Genre ‚â† emotional experience** ‚Äî people crave specific emotional textures like "quiet intimacy" or "bittersweet closure"
- **Behavior ‚â† true preference** ‚Äî what users have watched may reflect social norms, not authentic taste

This project aims to recommend movies based on **emotional resonance**, not just past behavior.

## üß† Methodology

### 1. **Emotional Tagging with LLM**
We used the OpenAI API to tag ~5,000 TMDb movies using four emotional dimensions:

```json
\{
  "title": "Movie Title",
  "emotional_experience": ["deep grief", "hopeful release"],
  "relational_themes": ["estranged siblings"],
  "life_moments": ["coming to terms with loss"],
  "aesthetic": ["muted tones", "slow pacing"]
\}
```

### 2. **Embedding & Similarity Matching**
- Transformed tags into vector embeddings
- Stored movie vectors locally in a pickle-based database
- Compared user input embedding using **cosine similarity**
- Returned top 3 emotionally aligned movies

### 3. **User Interface**
- Lightweight app (e.g. Streamlit or CLI)
- Users describe the emotion they want to feel
- System recommends emotionally matched films

## üí° Why Cosine Similarity?
Cosine similarity compares **angle** (not length) between vectors ‚Äî perfect for capturing **semantic alignment** in text-based embeddings.  
Other distances (e.g. Euclidean) can distort meaning by over-weighting magnitude, especially in high-dimensional space.
